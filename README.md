## Practice Blog Application

We are currently exploring the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in our class. After working with databases (such a sequel and sqlite3) and practicing pairing these databases with created servers (such as webrick and sinatra) to create basic websites, we have now moved onto using ruby on rails. This is my first attempt at creating an API in Rails. I will be following closely along with the Rails tutorial.
